# Exploration Versus Exploitation (Jepma & Nieuwenhuis)

Jepma & Nieuwenhuis (2011) have presented evidence from pupillary measurements that norepinephrine is related to the balance between exploration and exploitation. 
In particular, they suggest that uncertainty might be signaled by tonic norepinephrine (as measured by baseline pupil diameter), and that this signal predicts the shift from exploration to
exploitation. 
A simple way to track this uncertainty (see Frank et al., 2009) is using a Bayesian model of the reward distribution for each option. 
Specifically, each option is associated with an unknown reward probability; the learner represents their belief about this reward probability using a $ beta(a,b) $ distribution. 

Can this model can account for the relationship between pupil diameter and exploration/exploitation under the assumption that baseline pupil diameter is proportional to the entropy of the distribution over actions?
